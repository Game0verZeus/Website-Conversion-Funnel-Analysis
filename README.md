# Website Conversion Funnel Analysis

## Project Overview

This project revolves around analyzing user behavior on the Cool T-Shirts Inc. website. The primary focus is to construct a conversion funnel, which is a representation of the stages a user goes through, from visiting the website up to completing a purchase. By examining these stages, we can identify potential bottlenecks in the sales process.

## Project Goals

The goals of the project are to:

- Track the user journey from visiting the website to making a purchase.
- Identify the percentage of users dropping off at each stage of the process.
- Calculate the average time it takes for a user to make a purchase after visiting the website.

## Data Analysis Process

The analysis involves:

- Merging multiple datasets representing different stages in the conversion funnel.
- Calculating the null values to determine drop-off rates.
- Assessing the average time taken for a user to complete a purchase.
